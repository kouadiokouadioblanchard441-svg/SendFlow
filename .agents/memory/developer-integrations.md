description: Product decisions for merchant API credentials, payment sessions, and webhooks.

The merchant-space “Développeurs” area supports both direct API checkout and SendFlow-hosted checkout. Both payment modes must reuse LinkFlow’s configured country/operator fees and aggregator routing; do not hard-code a provider in the developer API. Webhooks may be emitted only for verified final payment results, after the existing settlement path credits the merchant wallet. Public integration documentation is a later milestone.

Each account receives one active public/secret API key pair during registration. Store only the public key and one-way hashes; return the secret only in the creation response, never persist or log it. Regeneration atomically revokes all currently active pairs and retains their revoked history. Live credentials must remain unavailable to test accounts, and API payment execution must stay closed until provider settlement evidence is validated.

**Why:** the user wants a key pair at account creation and the ability to regenerate it; one-time secret delivery avoids a recoverable plaintext credential, while rotation must invalidate old integrations.

**How to apply:** Create the initial pair in the registration transaction and expose it only in the signup response. Keep the secret in frontend memory only until the user continues. Serialize rotations per account and preserve revoked records. Keep session creation and success webhooks closed while `isLinkFlowPaymentExecutionEnabled` is false. Live API keys must not be issued to test accounts; implement a separate sandbox-key/provider flow before enabling API testing for those accounts. Ask before applying the additive developer schema migration to Neon.
